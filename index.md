## Personal Background

I was born in Guangzhou, China at April 22, 2003 and came to USA since high school. I went to Our Lady of Lourdes High School at Poughkeepsie, NY and decided that I would like to escape from the Eastcoast. My interests include gaming, working out, and playing basketball.

My favorite quote:
> "I'm the greatest. Everyone else is trash" - Yiliang "Doublelift" Peng

The first lines of codes I've ever written：
```
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}
```
